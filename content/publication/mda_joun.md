abstract = "Based on the research we have already down in the former paper ('A Reconfigurable Memristor-based Distance Accelerator for Time Series Mining on Data Centers' appeared on DAC'17), we employ our work to the end-to-end evaluation. Specially, we apply our work to two widely-used applications, similarity search and classification. Compared to existing works on GPUs and FPGAs, MDA shows little accuracy loss for similarity and classification applications."
