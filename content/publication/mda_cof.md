abstract = "we propose an efficient and recon- figurable memristor-based distance accelerator for real-time and energy-efficient data mining with time series on data centers. Common circuit structure is extracted to save chip areas, and the circuit can be configured to any specific dis- tance functions. Experimental results show that compared with existing works, our work has achieved a speedup of 3.5x-376x on performance and an improvement of 1-3 orders of magnitude on energy efficiency."
