# About me

Hello! I am a master student in Microelectronic Engineering Department at HUST. Currently, I am advised by Dr.Xiaowei Xu and I am doing research in CPSIL lab led by Prof.Yu Hu. My research focus is on time series data miming and embedded computing. We hope to design new optimized and energy-efficiency embedded architecture to accelerate distance function in data miming and apply deep learning algorithms to solve real world problems.

In addition, I am a passionate learner and willing to try new technologies. I also enjoy talking and sharing ideas with other people.
